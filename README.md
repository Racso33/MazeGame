A game where you walk in a randomly generated raycasted maze, with random colors... Or a bot walks and you watch. Once you reach the end, it generates a new one, and a new one, and a new one, and a new... 
The ultimate timewaster. Watch your computer endlessly solve mazes, and see the mazes solved counter go up. I plan on making this a proper idle game sometime.

Largely inspired by the Windows 9x 3d-maze screensaver.

To run, you have to have the SDL2 and SDL_ttf dlls.
